# Setting up CD/CI for a Java-Spring Application in a Kubernetes Cluster

This guide outlines the steps to implement Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI) for a simple Java-Spring application within a Kubernetes cluster. The CD/CI pipeline will be orchestrated using Git Actions, ArgoCD, and Docker images.

## Spring Application Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating a simple Spring application using Gradle. Follow these steps to set up your development environment, create a basic Spring project, and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Install the JDK by following the instructions provided on the [AdoptOpenJDK website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
2. Install Gradle by following the instructions on the [official Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/).
3. Install your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Step 2: Create a New Spring Project

1. Open your IDE and create a new Spring project.
2. Choose the appropriate Spring Initializer or Gradle archetype for your project. Include the necessary dependencies (e.g., Spring Boot, Spring Web).

### Step 3: Build and Run the Project

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Build the project using Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
